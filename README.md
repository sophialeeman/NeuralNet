# NeuralNet
I created a simple neural network from scratch, following advice from [Milo Spencer-Harper](https://medium.com/technology-invention-and-more/how-to-build-a-simple-neural-network-in-9-lines-of-python-code-cc8f23647ca1).

I used this network to analyze data from Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients retrieved from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chronic_Kidney_Disease) and processed by [odsti](https://github.com/odsti).

My network performed with 97% accuracy in predicting CKD and identified Albumin levels in urine as the strongest indicator of CKD.
